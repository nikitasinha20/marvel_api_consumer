## Usage

To use this gem, first configure it, by passing your Marvel API credentials (http://developer.marvel.com/)

    > require 'marvel_api_consumer'
    > MarvelApiConsumer.set_config({public_key: 'foo', private_key: 'bar'})
    
Once configured, you can do things like:
        
    > MarvelApiConsumer.total_characters # 1491
    > MarvelApiConsumer.paginated_character_list({limit: 50}) # optionally add page_limit - which is set to 50 by default (returns enum)
    > MarvelApiConsumer.character_list # gets the list of characters (returns enum)
    > MarvelApiConsumer.character_details(1011334) # get detailed info of a character using characterId
    
    
Following filters can be used to fetch data:
    
    1. name - Return only characters matching the specified full character name (e.g. Spider-Man).
    2. nameStartsWith - Return characters with names that begin with the specified string (e.g. Sp).
    3. comics - Return only characters which appear in the specified comics (accepts a comma-separated list of ids).
    4. series - Return only characters which appear the specified series (accepts a comma-separated list of ids).
    
Examples:
    
    > MarvelApiConsumer.character_list({name: "Spider-Man"}) # returns enum
    > MarvelApiConsumer.character_list({nameStartsWith: "sh"}) # returns enum
    > MarvelApiConsumer.character_list({comics: 21366}) # returns enum
    > MarvelApiConsumer.character_list({series: 1945}) # returns enum
         
An easy way to play with the gem without having to install it is to use the console. You need to have internet access as it will connect to the production Marvel API.
    
    $ ./bin/console
    > MarvelApiConsumer.set_config({public_key: 'foo', private_key: 'bar'})
    > MarvelApiConsumer.total_characters # 1491
